i honestly have no idea why you guys are even having these problems, so i’m kind of confused by the whole thing
each source has dedicated miners and haulers, so they don’t need tasks. I only build one structure at a time, so all my builders are building that. I run dedicated masons for the walls. Roads are maintained by specialized creeps. Anyone doesn’t have something to do they upgrade the controller
roads only get maintained occasionally

remote haulers repair their own roads

well, same creep role in same room - say, a courier (energy refiller for spawn / extensions, etc.) - having multiple dudes doing that they end up targeting same things often enough

not for me

my couriers are assigned groups

or combat, for example - how to decide to split attacks

splitting attacks is stupid, you want to maximize DPS on single targets to eliminate them quickly and lower your enemies stength

especially if they have healers

but i push those assignments out when i want to split for some reason

to peg healers for instance

i’ve found that reducing autonomy amongst creeps and having managers control them in groups ends up being more CPU efficient

if that helps explain the disconnect

my swarm is one :wink:
